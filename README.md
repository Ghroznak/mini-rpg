# mini-rpg
a small rpg project

Intended to be a tiny RPG with a generated player hero to fight monsters in different rooms.
Plan to add:
Ability to choose race for hero (modifier to stats)
Monsters generated on per room basis
Ability to move around map and get random encounters in the rooms
Add loot tables with items that modify stats
